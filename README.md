The Vundle installer for vim is installed by default in the home directory of the vagrant user (see provision.sh). For access from other profiles, change this.

To install packages (including syntax highlighting for Javascript) open Vim and use :PluginInstall. The Plugins are stored in the .vimrc file that's copied from your local machine.
